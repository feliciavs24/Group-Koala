## The cellular structure of the skin [2, 3]

The skin is divided into the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutis. The epidermis is the place of origin for skin lesions. The deepest layer of the epidermis, the stratum basale, houses the basal cells – stem cells of the skin – and melanocytes, cells that produce the skin’s pigment called melanin. The more superficial layers contain stratified squamous epithelial cells that become increasingly keratinized as they get closer to the surface of the skin.
