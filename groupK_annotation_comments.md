k1
Some photos clearly displayed distinct and evident lesions, but in others, the quality was notably poor, and the lesions appeared to merge with the surrounding skin. Distinguishing between the lesion, irritated skin, or typical discoloration proved to be quite difficult in many of the photos.

k2
One picture was skipped due to the low quality which meant that the lesion blended in with the rest of the skin which on this case was the top of a head. 

k3
Some lesions were so spread out and appeared almost like a rash which made it difficult to define the edges of the lesion. So our group made the decision to include the parts where the rash was the worst and exclude the rest in our annotations.

k4
At the beginning it was decided to annotate including the inflamed parts (often red skin) that weren't specifically the mole however in later photos it wasn't possible to also include inflamed skin (since almost the entire photo included inflamed areas) and therefore there seems to be a bit of inconsitency in the photos annotated. 


k5
Most images were of sufficient quality to mark the lesions, but some were too close in color to the surrounding skin, or the skin texture made it too difficult to discern the lesion from its surroundings, so 4 lesions in total were skipped. In some images, there appeared to be more than one lesion, but the general skin coloration or texture made it necessary to only mark parts of the skin that were definitely part of a lesion.
